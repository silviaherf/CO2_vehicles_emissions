## Resume


## Resources
For this project, the following datasets have been used. Specially thanks to their contributors for spreading so rich information about this sunject:

* **CO2 and GHG emission data**--> https://www.kaggle.com/srikantsahu/co2-and-ghg-emission-data

This dataset contains emission data of Green House Gases (in tonnes) of different countries from year 1750 - 2019.

* **Greenhouse Gas Emissions worldwide** --> https://www.kaggle.com/srikantsahu/co2-and-ghg-emission-data

The Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventory Data contains the most recently submitted information, covering the period from 1990 to the latest available year, to the extent the data have been provided (2012). The GHG data contain information on anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of the following GHGs (carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), unspecified mix of HFCs and PFCs, sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen triflouride (NF3)) that are not controlled by the Montreal Protocol.

* **Gas emissions (CO2-e) by transport sector** --> https://www.kaggle.com/mpwolke/cusersmarildownloadsdioxidecsv

Queensland annual greenhouse gas emissions in millions of tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent from 1990â€“2016 by transport sector.

* **CO2 Emission by Vehicles**--> https://www.kaggle.com/debajyotipodder/co2-emission-by-vehicles

This Dataset provide model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada.

To help you compare vehicles from different model years, the fuel consumption ratings for 1995 to 2014 vehicles have been adjusted to reflect the improved testing that is more representative of everyday driving. Note that these are approximate values that were generated from the original ratings, not from vehicle testing.

* **Registered vehicles Data by country** --> https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.A995 




## Structure

1) README.txt: As a resume for the content of the project an its development

2) .ipynb: Jupyer Notebook file that contains original data and its cleaning up

3) .ipynb: Jupyer Notebook file that contains the main script of the project

3) input: It contains the start over datasets, as mentioned before

4) Images_readme: Where the images appearing at the README file have been saved

5) src: It contains relevant files so that the code can be runned. These are .py files

6) output: It contains the extracted information from the code. For this project, graphs and figures have been taken out
